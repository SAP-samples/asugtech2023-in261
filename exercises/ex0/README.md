# Getting Started

Before you start with the actual tutorial, run through the following preparation steps.

Goal: you will install the Queue Cosnumer tool you will later use to consume events from Advanced Event Mesh

## Download or clone the tools for the session

There are two options to get access to the tools needed later. 

### Option 1 - Clone the GitHub repository 

To check out the project, clone this GitHub repository by opening a terminal (cmd in Windows search) and copying the below into the terminal window:

```
git clone https://github.tools.sap/D034841/L2W-AEM-Hands-On
```

Then open your Explorer and go to the folder that you have just cloned. 

You will find it in your user directory.

Go to: your user directory and then to L2W-AEM-Hands-On/tools/AEM Samples/src/basic-samples

### Option 2 - Download and unzip

Go to the [main](https://github.tools.sap/D034841/L2W-AEM-Hands-On/tree/main) folder. Download the AEM Samples.
